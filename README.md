Japanese Emoticons
==================
[chrome extension]

Extension that allows for very quick access to an extensive library of Japanese text based emojis.

### A humongous library of excellent text-bases emojis just a click away.

A convenient way to access a humongous library of emoticons. Perfect for all kinds of online interactions. 

There is something magical about Japanese emojis, they are a bit funky but unlike western ones they really excel at conveying emotions, and at the same time supported everywhere where unicode is allowed(count it as everywhere by now).

Unfortunately I could not find a worthwhile solution to get those emojis quickly without having to copy them from somewhere, and I missed the way you get to pick 'ascii' emojis on the iPhone. So this is my small homage to fill the missing niche that should have filled a long time ago, yet somehow wasn't.

Have pleasure using it. Those for whom it was written will certainly appreciate it.
